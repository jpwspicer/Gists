## Julia Basemap Examples

This repository contains examples of using Julia with the matplotlib basemap toolkit, mostly based on the [basemap Example Gallery](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/examples.html) at [matplotlib.org](matplotlib.org). 

Basemap is a library for plotting 2D data on maps. The maps can include shorelines, rivers, and political boundaries, onto which contours, images, vectors, lines, or points can be plotted. The leading open-source geographical visualization toolkit, basemap is primarily geared towards earth scientists, in particular oceanographers and meteorologists, but can be used effectively by data scientists and hobbyists of all disciplines.

A formatted version of the examples is available [here](https://gist.github.com/jpwspicer/bd738886467c56c5d029).
