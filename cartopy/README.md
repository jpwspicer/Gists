## Julia Cartopy Examples

This repository contains examples of using Julia with the matplotlib cartopy Python package, mostly based on the [Cartopy Example Gallery](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery.html) at [scitools.org.uk](http://scitools.org.uk/). 

Cartopy is a Python package designed to make drawing maps for data analysis and visualization as easy as possible. Originally developed at the UK Met Office, Cartopy allows scientists to visualize their data on maps quickly, easily, and most importantly, accurately.

Cartopy makes use of the powerful `PROJ.4`, `numpy`, and `shapely` libraries, and has a simple and intuitive drawing interface to `matplotlib` for creating publication-quality maps.

A formatted version of the examples is available [here](https://gist.github.com/jpwspicer/91c75f5cf7a2354fbb2d).
